# Easy-YT
This Python program simplifies the process of downloading videos off of [http://youtube.com/](YouTube) while also increasing download speed.
The script can be used to download vidoes in either MP4(Video) or MP3(Audio) formats. Multiple videos can be downloaded at the same time.
| The program works perfectly but there may be edge cases I have yet to pin down.

# Getting Started
## Requirements
1. selenium `pip install selenium`
2. pytube `pip install pytube`
3. chrome driver [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](Download correct driver) with version similar to your chrome browser.

That's it! Now you can run the script:
```
git clone https://github.com/raheelrjunaid/Easy-YT.git
cd Easy-YT
python main.py
```
